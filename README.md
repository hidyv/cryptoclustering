# cryptoclustering
The project Crypto cluster is an effort to predict the effect of 24 hour and 7-day price change on cryptocurrencies. It involves python and unsupervised learning.


1.	Using StandardScaler to normalize the data from CSV file.


2.	Finding the best value for k using inertia and the elbow curve.


3.	Clustering crypto currencies with K-Means using hvplot


4.	Perform a Principal Component Analysis with scaled data and reduce the features to three principal components.


5.	The total explained variance of the components is 89.4%.


6.	The best value for k using PCA data is the same as the one for scaled original data i.e.: 4.


7.	Plot the PCA clusters with hvplot.


8.	Compare both elbow curves and the cluster plots
